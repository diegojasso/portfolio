# The Problem
The challenge at Pademobile (a fintech startup) was designing products for financial inclusion in a country where less than the 50% of the population had a bank account. This involved months of user research, prototyping, and testing web/mobile applications. The platform peaked at 5M users across Mexico and Spain.
